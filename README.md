Hello!  This is a romhack and pet project by surskitty, based heavily on Pokemon Emerald but with a focus on double battles. It does have increased difficulty compared to the main games, but is not meant as a hard mode hack; you should be able to clear with a team of your favorites and only mild strategy.

This hack includes all the typical battle system upgrades from RHH's [pokeemerald-expansion](https://github.com/rh-hideout/pokeemerald-expansion/) 1.10.1, including Mega Evolution. Dynamax and Z-moves are _not_ present, however.

## Gameplay Changes
- As long as you have the HM, the appropriate badge, and a Pok&eacute;mon that can learn the move in your party, you can use Fly or Flash without devoting a moveslot to it.
- Pokemon can be nicknamed from the summary screen and have their moves relearned from the moves tab.
- TMs and move tutors are reusable. TMs are unaltered from vanilla. Move tutors are massively expanded.
- Castform gets +10 bst in each non-HP stat when form changed.

## Move Tutor Locations
- The former home of the Slateport Name Rater now gives a variety of damaging coverage moves for early game.
- The old man in the Mauville Pok&eacute;mon Center teaches terrain and weather moves, plus damaging moves affected by terrain and weather. Yes, this means Sunny Day is both a move tutor and a TM. The old man has Snowscape; Hail remains a TM. I wanted to preserve the option of which one I use.
- The Move Reminder outside of Fallarbor now teaches egg moves.
- The Metronome tutor in the Fallarbor mart teaches a bunch of nondamaging utility moves.

## Evolution Methods
- Trade evolutions all work like Legends Arceus, which is to say: you use the item. Most evolution items can be bought in the Lilycove Department Store.
- Pikachu and Exeggutor evolve into their Alolan Forms with a Sun Stone.
- Koffing evolves into Galarian Weezing by raising its Beauty.
- Cubone evolves into Alolan Marowak with a Fire Stone.
- Eevee evolves into Espeon with a Sun Stone, Umbreon with a Moon Stone, Sylveon with friendship and a Fairy move, Leafeon with a Leaf Stone, and Glaceon with either an Ice Stone or by bringing it into the Shoal Cave ice room. Leafeon has no location evolution method for balance reasons.
- Charcadet evolves into Armarouge with a Dawn Stone and Ceruledge with a Dusk Stone.
- Ursaring evolves into Ursaluna with the Moon Stone. This may be changed to a map location if I ever bother sorting out somewhere swampy, probably around Mossdeep.

## Noncanon Abilities & Traits
Credits to [bassforte123](https://github.com/bassforte123/pokeemerald-complete/tree/Trait-System)'s system for having Pok&eacute;mon have multiple abilities. 

Pok&eacute;mon still have the Ability slot as in canon, but all members of a species also have up to three Traits. On the whole, most Pok&eacute;mon have been given their weakest, most iconic, or most interesting strategically canon ability as a Trait, with the ability slots shuffled appropriately so that wild Pok&eacute;mon and unimportant trainers should be interestingly diverse. Some Pok&eacute;mon, such as Castform's weather forms, have been given multiple Traits, and some like Obstagoon and Flygon now inherit abilities from their earlier stages.

Entrainment, Skill Swap, Trace, and other Ability-changing effects only work with Abilities, not Traits. For that reason, some Pok&eacute;mon like Plusle have Plus as both a Trait and an Ability. It does not stack; there is no advantage to having an Ability identical to the Trait unless you intend on altering Abilities in some manner.

My intention is for each Pok&eacute;mon species to have at least one thing it's good at, without being unintuitive what's within a Pok&eacute;mon's capabilities. The following is not a complete changelog; canon Abilities moved to Traits and Hidden Abilities moved to regular Abilities are not listed, except when particularly noteworthy.
- The Treecko line now has Sharpness as their Hidden Ability, Overgrow as a Trait, and Unburden as the regular Ability.
- The Torchic line has Quick Feet as their regular Ability, Blaze as a Trait, and Speed Boost as the Hidden Ability.
- The Mudkip line has Hydration as their Hidden Ability, Torrent as a Trait, and Damp as their regular Ability. Mega Swampert has both Torrent and Damp as Traits, as it's the least exciting starter to mega evolve.
- Beautifly has Berserk as a Trait, and Dustox has Toxic Debris.
- Surskit has Supersweet Syrup as a Trait, and Masquerain has Analytic and Wind Rider as its traits.
- Slaking is entirely unchanged to encourage Skill Swap shenanigans.
- Loudred and Exploud have Punk Rock as a Hidden Ability.
- Plusle has Costar as a Hidden Ability. Minun has Friend Guard as a Hidden Ability.
- Cacnea and Cacturne have Sand Veil as their Trait, and Water Absorb or Stakeout as their Abilities.
- Sunny Castform has as its Traits Flash Fire and Solar Power; Rainy Castform has Water Bubble; Snowy Castform has Snow Cloak and Ice Body.
- Chimecho has Levitate as its Trait, and Levitate and Hospitality as its Abilities. As mentioned above, Levitate in both slots is to encourage Skill Swap.
- Alolan Vulpix has Frisk as a Trait; Alolan Ninetales has Magician as a Trait. This is in reference to [the Cosmic Eclipse card.](https://pkmncards.com/card/alolan-ninetales-cosmic-eclipse-cec-145/)
