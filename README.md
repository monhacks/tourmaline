# Pok&eacute;mon Tourmaline
This is a romhack based off of [PokeEmerald](https://github.com/pret/pokeemerald) and especially the [PokeEmerald Expansion](https://github.com/rh-hideout/pokeemerald-expansion) to focus on double battles in a semi-traditional Pokemon game.
## Credits
- surskitty, as main person working on this.
- pret, for decomps.
- RH Hideout, for the PokeEmerald Expansion, so that I don't have to reinvent the wheel adding more pok&eacute;mon.
- Thousand Roads discord, for moral support and playtesting.
