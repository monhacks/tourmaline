# Pok&eacute;mon Tourmaline
This is a romhack based off of [PokeEmerald](https://github.com/pret/pokeemerald) and especially the [PokeEmerald Expansion](https://github.com/rh-hideout/pokeemerald-expansion) to focus on double battles in a semi-traditional Pokemon game.
## Details
- National Dex up through USUM!
- All Pok&eacute;mon evolve without trading. Haunter and Dusknoir require a Dusk Stone; Magmar uses a Fire Stone; Alolan Exeggutor uses a Sun Stone; Electabuzz, Nosepass, and Magneton use Thunder Stones; Glaceon uses an Ice Stone; Leafeon uses a Leaf Stone.
- The starting PC contains a Master Ball in the event of shinies.
