# Pok&eacute;mon Tourmaline
This is a romhack based off of [PokeEmerald](https://github.com/pret/pokeemerald) and especially the [PokeEmerald Expansion](https://github.com/rh-hideout/pokeemerald-expansion) to focus on double battles in a semi-traditional Pokemon game.
## Details
- Kadabra evolves at level 32. Graveler and Boldore evolve at level 37. Machoke evolves at level 42. Haunter evolves with a Dusk Stone.
- All location evolutions use the Thunder, Ice, or Leaf Stones.
