# Pok&eacute;mon Tourmaline
This is a romhack based off of [PokeEmerald](https://github.com/pret/pokeemerald) and especially the [PokeEmerald Expansion](https://github.com/rh-hideout/pokeemerald-expansion) to focus on double battles in a semi-traditional Pokemon game.

Most important things for players are over on [the wiki](https://github.com/surskitty/tourmaline/wiki).
